# Creating a Docker Compose File

The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:

- On App Server 3 in Stratos DC create a container named `httpd` using a docker compose file `/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml` (please use the exact name for file).

- Use `httpd` (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as `httpd`; you can use any name for `service`.

- Map `80` number port of container with port `8083` of docker host.

- Map container's `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` volume with `/opt/finance` volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

## Steps

1. Login into App Server 3
2. Make sure docker is running and accessible, you can check simply runing:

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```

3. Let's create the `/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```sh
    sudo vi /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml
    ```

    - Open the file in editor and copy paste the contents from below
    ```sh
    services:
      apache:
          image: httpd:latest
          container_name: httpd

      volumes:
         - "/opt/data:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs"
      ports:
        - "8083:80"
    ```

4. Let's run the compose file

    ```sh
    docker compose -f /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

5. Let's verify if it's running or not

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```
