# 📦 Day 9 – Website Backup Automation using Bash Script

## 🏢 Scenario

The production support team of **xFusionCorp Industries** needs to automate website backups.

They have a **static website** running on **App Server 3** in Stratos Datacenter.  
The requirement is to create a **bash script** that:

- Creates a **ZIP backup** of the website directory
- Stores it in a local backup directory
- Copies it to a **remote backup server**
- Does **not** ask for password while copying

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Create a script: `beta_backup.sh`
- Location: `/scripts` directory
- Create ZIP archive: `xfusioncorp_beta.zip`
- Source directory: `/var/www/html/beta`
- Local backup path: `/backup/`
- Remote backup server path: `/backup/`
- Copy should be **passwordless** using SSH keys

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- Bash scripting
- ZIP archiving
- SSH key-based authentication
- SCP file transfer
- Linux permissions (`chmod`)

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites (Done Outside Script)

> ⚠️ As mentioned in the task, dependencies are installed manually.

```bash
sudo yum install zip -y
# or
sudo apt install zip -y

Setup Passwordless SSH
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id user@nautilus-backup-server


Test:

ssh user@nautilus-backup-server

📝 Script: beta_backup.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Create ZIP archive
zip -r /backup/xfusioncorp_beta.zip /var/www/html/beta

# Copy to backup server
scp /backup/xfusioncorp_beta.zip user@nautilus-backup-server:/backup/

🔐 Make Script Executable
chmod +x /scripts/beta_backup.sh

▶️ Run the Script
/scripts/beta_backup.sh

✅ Expected Result

File created: /backup/xfusioncorp_beta.zip

File copied to: Backup Server → /backup/

No password prompt

Backup successful

🧪 Verification Commands
ls -lh /backup/
ssh user@nautilus-backup-server "ls -lh /backup/"

📚 What I Learned

How to automate backups using bash

How to use zip in scripts

How to setup SSH key-based authentication

How to copy files using scp

Why chmod +x is required to run scripts

🧠 Important Linux Concepts
Concept	Purpose
zip	Create compressed archive
scp	Copy files over SSH
ssh-keygen	Generate SSH keys
ssh-copy-id	Enable passwordless login
chmod +x	Make script executable
🎤 Interview Q&A
Q1. How do you automate backups in Linux?

Answer:
By writing a shell script that archives the data and copies it to a backup server using scp or rsync.

Q2. Why is SSH key-based authentication used?

Answer:
To enable passwordless and secure automation between servers.

Q3. Why do we need chmod +x?

Answer:
Linux does not allow execution of a file unless it has execute permission.

Q4. Why did we use ZIP instead of tar.gz?

Answer:
Because the requirement explicitly asked for a ZIP archive.

⭐ Good to Know

Most production automation failures happen due to:

Missing permissions

Missing tools

Wrong paths

No SSH access

Script not executable
