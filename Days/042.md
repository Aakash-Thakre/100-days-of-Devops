# Create Docker Network

The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

- Create a docker network named as news on App Server 1 in Stratos DC.
- Configure it to use bridge drivers.
- Set it to use subnet 10.10.1.0/24 and iprange 10.10.1.0/24.

##Steps

1. Login into app server 1 and run the following command:
   
   ```docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 10.10.1.0/24 --ip-range 10.10.1.0/24 beta```
   
2. Verify the created network

   ```docker network ls```
