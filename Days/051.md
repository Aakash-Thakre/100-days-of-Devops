# Execute Rolling Updates in Kubernetes

An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image nginx:1.18 with the latest updates.

- Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the nginx:1.18 image. The deployment is named nginx-deployment.

- Ensure all pods are operational post-update.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster

## Steps

1. Let's update image version:

    ```sh
    kubectl set image deployments/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.18
    ```

    > We have to use `set image` command with **deployment name** and **container name**

2. Let's verify the rollout status

   ```sh
    kubectl rollout status deployments/nginx-deployment
    ```
3. check the pod status again it should be running
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```
