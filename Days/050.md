# Set Resource Limits in Kubernetes Cluster

The Nautilus DevOps team has noticed performance issues in some Kubernetes-hosted applications due to resource constraints. To address this, they plan to set limits on resource utilization. Here are the details:

- Create a pod named `httpd-pod` with a container named `httpd-container`. Use the `httpd` image with the latest tag (specify as httpd:latest). Set the following resource limits:
- Requests: Memory: 15Mi, CPU: 100m
- Limits: Memory: 20Mi, CPU: 100m

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Let's create apache-pod.yaml file with with the below content. Our updated file will be look like this:

    ```YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
        name: httpd-pod
        labels:
            app: httpd_pod
    spec:
        containers:
            - name: httpd-container
              image: httpd:latest
              ports:
                - containerPort: 80
              resources:
                limits:
                    cpu: 100m
                    memory: 20Mi
                requests:
                    cpu: 100m
                    memory: 15Mi
    ```

2. Let's create the pod:

   ```sh
   kubectl create -f apache-pod.yml
   ```

3. Verify pod:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```
