# Linux User Setup with Non-interactive Shell

To accommodate the backup agent tool's specifications, the system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries requires the creation of a user with a non-interactive shell. Here's your task:

Create a user named mariyam with a non-interactive shell on App Server 3.

#Steps

```
sudo useradd -m -s /usr/sbin/nologin mariyam

```

- `s`: for shell, here we are giving nologin shell

- `m`: for user home directory, It will create a directory with user-name under /home
