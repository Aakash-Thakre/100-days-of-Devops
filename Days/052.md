# Execute Rollback in Kubernetes Cluster

Earlier today, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a new release for an application. However, a customer has reported a bug related to this recent release. Consequently, the team aims to revert to the previous version.

- There exists a deployment named nginx-deployment; initiate a rollback to the previous revision.

## Steps

1. Let's see the deployments and pods

    ```sh
    kubectl get all
    ```

2. Let's see current container image version

    ```sh
    kubectl describe pods pod-name
    ```

3. To roll back the deployment to our previous version, use the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl rollout undo deployments/nginx-deployment
    ```
