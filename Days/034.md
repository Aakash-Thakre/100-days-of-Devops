# Configure Githook

- Create a post-update hook in this git repository so that whenever any changes are pushed to the master branch, it creates a release tag with name release-2023-06-15, where 2023-06-15 is supposed to be the current date. For example if today is 20th June, 2023 then the release tag must be release-2023-06-20. Make sure you test the hook at least once and create a release tag for today's release.
