# Deploy Nginx Web Server on Kubernetes Cluster

Some of the Nautilus team developers are developing a static website and they want to deploy it on Kubernetes cluster. They want it to be highly available and scalable. Therefore, based on the requirements, the DevOps team has decided to create a deployment for it with multiple replicas. Below you can find more details about it:

- Create a deployment using nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e nginx:latest. Name it as nginx-deployment. The container should be named as nginx-container, also make sure replica counts are 3.

- Create a NodePort type service named nginx-service. The nodePort should be 30011.

## Steps

1. Create a `nginix-deployment.yml` using this content below:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
   spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: nginx-container
              image: nginx:latest
   
   ```
    
3. Create a `nginx-service.yaml` file using below content:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: nginx-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: nginx
      type: NodePort
      ports:
        - port: 80
          targetPort: 80
          nodePort: 30011
   ```
4. Run the following command to create deployment and service:

    ```sh
    kubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yml
    kubectl create -f nginx-service.yml
    ```

5. Verify results:

    ```sh
    kubectl get all
    ```
