# Docker Python App

A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be deployed on App Server 3. We have already copied a requirements.txt file (having the app dependencies) under /python_app/src/ directory on App Server 3. Further complete this task as per details mentioned below:

- Create a Dockerfile under /python_app directory:

  - Use any python image as the base image.
  - Install the dependencies using requirements.txt file.
  - Expose the port 3003.
  - Run the server.py script using CMD.

- Build an image named nautilus/python-app using this Dockerfile.

- Once image is built, create a container named pythonapp_nautilus:

  - Map port 3003 of the container to the host port 8099.

- Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App Server 3.

## Steps

1. Login into App server and move into directory

    ```sh
    cd /pythona_app
    ```

2. Create Docker file and copy paste the contents:

    ```sh
    sudo vi Dockerfile
    ```

    ```Dockerfile
    
    FROM python:slim

    WORKDIR /app
    
    COPY src/requirements.txt .
    COPY src/server.py .
     
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    
    EXPOSE 3003
    
    CMD ["python","server.py"]
                        
    ```

3. Build Docker Image

    ```sh
    docker build -t nautilus/python-app .
    ```

4. Run the container

    ```sh
    docker run -d --name pythonapp_nautilus -p 8099:3003 nautilus/python-app
    ```

5. Verify

    ```sh
    docker ps
    curl http://localhost:8099
    ```
