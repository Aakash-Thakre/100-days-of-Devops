# Deploy Pods in Kubernetes Cluster

The Nautilus DevOps team is diving into Kubernetes for application management. One team member has a task to create a pod according to the details below:

- Create a pod named pod-httpd using the httpd image with the latest tag. Ensure to specify the tag as httpd:latest.

- Set the app label to httpd_app, and name the container as httpd-container.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Create a `appache-pod.yml` file inside the jump host with below content
  ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: pod-httpd
      labels:
        app: httpd_app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: httpd-container
          image: httpd:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  ```
2. Run the following command to create pod in kubernetes cluster:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f appache-pod.yml
    ```

3. Check if pod is running or not:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```
