# Deploy Applications with Kubernetes Deployments

The Nautilus DevOps team is delving into Kubernetes for app management. One team member needs to create a deployment following these details:

Create a deployment named httpd to deploy the application httpd using the image httpd:latest (ensure to specify the tag)

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Let's create the `apache-deployment.yml` file with these contents:

   ```YAML
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: httpd
      labels:
        app: httpd-app
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: httpd-app
      template:
        metadata:
          name: httpd-pod
          labels:
            app: httpd-app
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: httpd
              image: httpd:latest
              ports:
                - containerPort: 80
    
   ```

2. Run the following commands to create the deployment:

   ```sh
    kubectl create -f apache-deployment.yml
   ```

3. Verify Deployments

   ```sh
    kubectl get deployments.apps
   ```
